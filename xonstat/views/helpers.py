class RecentGame(object):
    '''
    This is a helper class to facilitate showing recent games
    data within mako. The idea is to take the results of a query
    and transform it into class members easily accessible later.
    It is like a namedtuple but a little easier to form.

    The constructor takes a query row that has been fetched, and
    it requires the following columns to be present in the row:

        game_id, game_type_cd, game_type_descr, winner, start_dt,
        server_id, server_name, map_id, map_name, player_id, nick,
        rank, team

    The following columns are optional:

        elo_delta

    This class is meant to be used in conjunction with recent_games_q,
    which will return rows matching this specification.
